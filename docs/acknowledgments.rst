PyImfit is based on André Luiz de Amorim’s
`python-imfit <https://github.com/streeto/python-imfit>`__ wrapper about
an earlier version of **Imfit**.

Imfit-related Acknowledgements
------------------------------

Major inspirations for **Imfit** include both GALFIT and BUDDA.

Thanks also to Michael Opitsch and Michael Williams for being (partly
unwitting) beta testers and for their feedback, to Martin Kuemmel for
suggesting an early improvement (and finding a related bug), to Roberto
Saglia for urging me to implement the Core-Sérsic function, and to
Maximilian Fabricius for suggesting improvements to the documentation.
Additional bug reports and suggestions from André Luiz de Amorim, Giulia
Savorgnan, David Streich, Guillermo Barro, Sergio Pascual, Lee Kelvin,
Colleen Gilhuly, Semyeong Oh, Benne Holwerde, David Wilman, Iskren
Georgiev, Corentin Schreiber, Dan Prole, Alex Borlaff, and Daria Kozlova
are gratefully appreciated. Thanks also to Wolf Vollprecht for help with
figuring out the building of conda package versions.
