SIMPLE NOTES ON HOW TO BUILD CONDA PACKAGES WITH RATTLER-BUILD

The following will generate packages for Python 3.8--3.12

$ cd /Users/erwin/coding/pyimfit/conda
$ rattler-build build --recipe ./rattler_setup --variant-config ./rattler_setup/variant_config.yaml

Generated conda packages will be in a subdirectory of output/
Doing this on MacBook Pro 2019
	output/osx-64 -- for Intel (x86-64) binaries
Doing this in Ubuntu VM on MBPro 2019
	output/linux-64 -- for Intel Linux binaries


HOW TO UPLOAD:

Activate a conda environment that has the anaconda client installed, then log in to Anaconda
% conda activate <environment-name>
% anaconda login

Use "anaconda upload" and the names of the .conda (or .tar.bz2) files

MacOS Intel:
% anaconda upload output/osx-86/pyimfit-*.conda   [change output subdirectory name as appropriate]
Ubuntu VM (Intel):
% anaconda upload output/linux-64/pyimfit-*.conda   [change output subdirectory name as appropriate]

These will be uploaded to https://anaconda.org/perwin/pyimfit


SUMMARY -- HOW TO INSTALL:
% conda install -c conda-forge perwin::pyimfit

The "-c conda-forge" usage is necessary to get installation of python_abi, which
was automatically generated as a requirement when pyimfit was built.

(If people for some reason *don't* have anaconda as a default channel, they might
have trouble finding perwin::pyimfit, so they could try adding "-c anaconda".)



TROUBLESHOOTING:

[19 July 2024]
Intel Mac:
After creating v0.99.0 conda packages and uploading them, installation & testing for
py310_test and py311_test worked, but installation for py312_test kept failing, with errors like this:

LibMambaUnsatisfiableError: Encountered problems while solving:
  - nothing provides python_abi 3.11.* *_cp311 needed by pyimfit-0.13.3-py311he7fa5d1_0

Could not solve for environment specs
The following packages are incompatible
└─ pyimfit is not installable because there are no viable options
   ├─ pyimfit [0.13.3|0.99.0] would require
   │  └─ python_abi 3.11.* *_cp311, which does not exist (perhaps a missing channel);
   ├─ pyimfit 0.99.0 would require
   │  └─ python_abi 3.10.* *_cp310, which does not exist (perhaps a missing channel);
   └─ pyimfit 0.99.0 would require
      └─ python_abi 3.12.* *_cp312, which does not exist (perhaps a missing channel).

I was able to fix this by *first* installing python_abi, via
$ conda install -c conda-forge python_abi

[totally unclear why this is an issue]
