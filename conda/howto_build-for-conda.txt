SIMPLE NOTES ON HOW TO BUILD CONDA PACKAGES WITH RATTLER-BUILD

The following will generate packages for Python 3.8--3.12

$ cd /Users/erwin/coding/pyimfit/conda
$ rattler-build build --recipe ./rattler_setup --variant-config ./rattler_setup/variant_config.yaml

Generated conda packages will be in a subdirectory of output/
Doing this on MacBook Pro 2019
	output/osx-64 -- for Intel (x86-64) binaries
Doing this in Ubuntu VM on MBPro 2019
	output/linux-64 -- for Intel Linux binaries


HOW TO UPLOAD:

Activate a conda environment that has the anaconda client installed, then log in to Anaconda
% conda activate <environment-name>
% anaconda login

Use "anaconda upload" and the names of the .conda (or .tar.bz2) files

MacOS Intel:
% anaconda upload output/osx-86/pyimfit-*.conda   [change output subdirectory name as appropriate]
Ubuntu VM (Intel):
% anaconda upload output/linux-64/pyimfit-*.conda   [change output subdirectory name as appropriate]

These will be uploaded to https://anaconda.org/perwin/pyimfit


SUMMARY -- HOW TO INSTALL:
% conda install -c conda-forge perwin::pyimfit

The "-c conda-forge" usage is necessary to get installation of python_abi, which
was automatically generated as a requirement when pyimfit was built.

(If people for some reason *don't* have anaconda as a default channel, they might
have trouble finding perwin::pyimfit, so they could try adding "-c anaconda".)
